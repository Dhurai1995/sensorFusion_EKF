# Sensor fusion 
Out of the 6DOF of pose/orientation, 3 of the most important pose was chosen for simplification. They are position in X, Y and orientation of Z axis.

## Setting up the environment
1. Install pyCharm.
1. Open the folder "sensorFusion_MoveAI" within pyCharm.

# Set up the code
1. open and run the "ExtendedKalmanfileter.py".

# Reasons
Used a Extended kalman filter as it offers a sufficient accuracy between kalman filter and particle filter without excessive complexity and computation time. 


# Issues

1. Data from the LIDAR data was not utilized.
